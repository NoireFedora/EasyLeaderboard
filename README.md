## Note
This Javascript library is fully developed by myself to fullfill the requirement of CSC309 Individual Project that to build my own Javascript library.

## Getting Started

At first, you need to include this library and its style sheet in the <strong>Head</strong> part of your html file. <br>
<code><script defer type="text/javascript" src='EasyLeaderboard.js'></script></code> <br>
<code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./styles.css"&gt;</code> <br>
<br>
To create a new Leaderboard, you need to have a div tag with a unique Id in the <strong>Body</strong> part of your html file. <br>
Here is an example: <br>
<code><script defer type="text/javascript" src='EasyLeaderboard.js'></script></code> <br>
